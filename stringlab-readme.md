# StringLab ‚Äî JS Strings Masterclass

An interactive, single-file web application that provides a comprehensive hands-on tutorial for JavaScript string manipulation. Learn everything from basic string operations to advanced Unicode handling, regex patterns, and performance optimization ‚Äî all in one place.

## üöÄ Features

### **Interactive String Editor**
- Real-time string manipulation with a built-in text editor
- Live preview of transformations without modifying the original input
- One-click apply functionality to replace input with transformed results

### **Comprehensive String Analysis**
- **UTF-16 length** vs **code points** vs **grapheme clusters**
- Character-by-character breakdown with Unicode code points
- UTF-8 byte count calculation
- Word and line counting

### **String Transformations**
- Case transformations (upper, lower, title, swap case)
- String slicing with `slice()`, `substring()`, and `substr()`
- Text trimming and whitespace collapsing
- String repetition and padding operations

### **Advanced Regex & Pattern Matching**
- Interactive find and replace with regex support
- Live highlighting of search patterns
- Capture group replacement with `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- Auto-linkification of @mentions and #hashtags

### **Unicode & Emoji Support**
- Proper handling of emojis, skin tones, and family emojis
- Combining character sequences (accents, diacritics)
- Code point visualization and analysis
- Grapheme cluster counting using `Intl.Segmenter`

### **Encoding & Decoding**
- Base64 encoding/decoding with proper Unicode support
- UTF-8 byte representation
- HTML entity escaping

### **Template Literals & Interpolation**
- Safe variable interpolation from JSON objects
- Tagged template demonstration with HTML escaping
- `String.raw` examples

### **Utility Functions**
- URL-friendly slug generation
- HTML escaping for safe output
- String padding with custom characters
- Text normalization and cleanup

### **Performance Testing**
- String concatenation vs array join benchmarking
- Real-time performance measurement
- Scalable test sizes

## üéØ Educational Objectives

This project is designed to teach:

- **String Fundamentals**: Understanding JavaScript's string type and immutability
- **Unicode Complexities**: Difference between UTF-16 code units, code points, and grapheme clusters
- **Regex Mastery**: Pattern matching, flags, and capture groups
- **Performance Awareness**: Efficient string building techniques
- **Real-world Applications**: Common string utilities used in web development
- **Edge Cases**: Proper handling of emojis, accented characters, and international text

## üõ† Getting Started

### **Installation**
1. Save the HTML file as `index.html`
2. Save the CSS file as `string_project.css`  
3. Save the JavaScript file as `string_project.js`
4. Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser

**No server required!** This is a completely self-contained, client-side application.

### **Usage**
1. **Start with the sample text** or load one of the presets (Short, Emoji-heavy, Accented, URL)
2. **Explore transformations** using the buttons in the left panel
3. **Try the interactive features** in the right panel cards
4. **Experiment with edge cases** like emojis, accented characters, and complex Unicode sequences

## üìã Key Learning Areas
